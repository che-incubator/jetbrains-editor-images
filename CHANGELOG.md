## [20220221]

### News

- Integrated Projector [server](https://github.com/JetBrains/projector-server) and [client](https://github.com/JetBrains/projector-client) source code as git subtree to the repository which can be rebased with upstream repository by calling `./projector.sh rebase` command. ([#89](https://github.com/che-incubator/jetbrains-editor-images/pull/89)) Before performing the rebase there is some git configuration should be performed by adding remotes for the Projector server and client:

  ```sh
  $ git remote add upstream-projector-server https://github.com/JetBrains/projector-server
  $ git fetch upstream-projector-server master
  $ git remote add upstream-projector-client https://github.com/JetBrains/projector-client
  $ git fetch upstream-projector-client master
  ```

- Update devfiles to version 2.1 ([#71](https://github.com/che-incubator/jetbrains-editor-images/pull/71))

## [20210723]

### News

- Removed auxiliary patch to support single host environment

- Build community images in Brew compliant way. ([#40](https://github.com/che-incubator/jetbrains-editor-images/pull/40))

  To be a part of Codeready Workspaces there are some important changes come:

  - Projector Build performed only on the host machine, **not inside the container**. To build the Projector Client and Projector Server it is only enough to have at least JDK 11 and configured environment variable `JAVA_HOME`.

  - IDE downloads to the host machine, **not inside the container**. This allows to apply caching mechanism to speedup the image build from ~5-6 minutes to 1-2 minutes.

  - Changed `compatible-ide.json` configuration by using the CDN links to have ability to cache downloaded packages.

  - [Internal] Removed build arguments from the Dockerfile. So to build the image performs as usual, by calling `./projector.sh build`.

  - Removed `--projector-only` parameter and introduced `--prepare` instead. This parameter will perform all necessary work to prepare the assembly before Docker build. So calling:

    ```sh
    $ ./projector.sh build --prepare
    ```

    will prepare Projector Server and Projector Client sources, download the IDE packaging and omit the Docker build step. Then Docker image can be simply built by calling:

    ```sh
    $ DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --progress=auto -t <image_name> -f Dockerfile .
    ```

  - Removed `--no-projector-build` parameter. As far as Projector Server and Projector Client builds only on the host machine.

### Changed

- Bump Projector Client and Projector Server SHA1 revisions to fetch the latest upstream changes ([#37](https://github.com/che-incubator/jetbrains-editor-images/pull/37))
- Update ubi image version from 8.3-298 to 8.4-205 ([#38](https://github.com/che-incubator/jetbrains-editor-images/pull/38))
