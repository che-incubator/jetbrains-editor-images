# Arbitrary Swing app

Here you can find instructions how to use an arbitrary Swing app with Projector.

This page isn't ready, but as for a server, you can find instructions here:

- Running your app headlessly: [projector-server](https://github.com/JetBrains/projector-server).
- Running your app with GUI: [projector-agent](https://github.com/JetBrains/projector-server/tree/master/projector-agent).
- Demo Swing app that can be run using these methods: [projector-demo](https://github.com/JetBrains/projector-demo).

Info on clients is the [same as for JetBrains IDEs](../ij_user_guide/accessing.md).

If the instructions don't answer your questions and/or you want us to finish this page, feel free to open a ticket at our [issue tracker](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/PRJ).
